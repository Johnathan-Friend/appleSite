            <p>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, featuring a graphical user interface and a mouse, revolutionizing personal computing. However, internal conflicts led to Steve Jobs leaving Apple in 1985.
                
            Throughout the '90s, Apple faced challenges with market share and product success. In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple and initiated a remarkable turnaround. Under his leadership, the company introduced iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad.</p>
            <p>The iPod, released in 2001, transformed the music industry with its portable digital music player and the iTunes Store, while the iPhone, launched in 2007, revolutionized smartphones and changed how people interacted with mobile technology.
            
            Apple's focus on design, user experience, and an integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services has been central to its success. The company expanded its offerings with services like the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.
            
            In 2022, Apple continues to innovate with new products, services, and initiatives, including advancements in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, health technology, and environmental sustainability.</p>
